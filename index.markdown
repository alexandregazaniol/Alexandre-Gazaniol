Welcome to my homepage !

I work as an economist within the Impact Assessment Unit of the French public investment bank [Bpifrance](https://www.bpifrance.fr/). I previously held a position as an economist specialized in industrial policy at the [French Treasury](https://www.tresor.economie.gouv.fr/).

I obtained my Ph.D in economics under the supervision of Prof. Jean-Marc SiroÃ«n at the University Paris-Dauphine. My thesis evaluates the impact of outward foreign direct investment (FDI) on domestic production, employment and innovation, using French firm-level data. During my thesis, I worked as an economic researcher with a CIFRE contract at the consulting company [Pramex International](https://www.pramex.com/), a subsidiary of the banking group BPCE.
